# CTF Solves

## This repo is where I am going to store write ups for various CTF challenges I solve. As of August 31st, 2022, I committed to actually learn more about ethical hacking and cybersecurity on my own. Specifically, I decided to participate in CTF and other challenges. I know that I will appreciate previous solutions in the future and therefore I should document how I solve things, especially when they are difficult. Furthermore, maybe this repo will be of use to others in the future as they learn cybersecurity.
